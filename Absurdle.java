Absurdle
The purpose of this class is to make a game similar to the New York Times game, wordle.
The game prompts the user to enter a dictionary file and length of word they wish to play with.
The user then enters a word to try and guess the word that the game has chosen. If the player
enters a word and a letter is in the right spot when compared correct word, the word they typed in
will have the character that was placed in the exact location be replaced with a green square. If
the user enters a character thats word contains but is not in the right spot, that character will
be replaced by a yellow square. But the twist is that the game changes the word everytime the
player makes a guess in order to keep the game going for as long as possible.
